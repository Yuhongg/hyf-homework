Heat the oil in a large pan over medium high heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper to taste.

Add the ginger to the chicken and cook for 30 seconds more.
Place the chicken mixture on a plate and cover with foil to keep warm.
Add the zucchini and red bell pepper to the pan and cook for 3-4 minutes or until softened. Add the chicken back to the pan with the vegetables.
In a bowl whisk together the chicken broth, honey and soy sauce. 
In a small bowl mix the cornstarch with a tablespoon of cold water.
